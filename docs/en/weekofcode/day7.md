# Intro to Loops
## Overview
Concepts Taught: Using loops to repeat code multiple times.
## Learning plan:
Introduction to Loops:
Explain the concept of loops and their importance in programming.
Discuss the difference between for and while loops.
### For Loop:
Initialization: $i = 0 creates a new variable $i and sets it to 0.
Condition: $i < 10 checks if the value of $i is less than 10.
Increment: $i++ increments the value of $i by 1.
Example:
```
// Print "I am a programmer" 10 times
for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
  @display("I am a programmer");
}
```

### While Loop:
Condition: $i < 10 checks if the value of $i is less than 10.
Increment: $i++ increments the value of $i by 1.
Example:
```
$i = 0;
while ($i < 10) {
  @display("I am a programmer");
  $i++;
}
```

## Challenge:
```
Create a loop that prints "Learning BhashaX is fun!" 5 times using both for and while loops.
// For Loop
for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {
  @display("Learning BhashaX is fun!");
}

// While Loop
$i = 0;
while ($i < 5) {
  @display("Learning BhashaX is fun!");
  $i++;
}
```
